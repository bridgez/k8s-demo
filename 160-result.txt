Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 9.111.105.160:6443 --token dyw714.wqonhl7s6zg43ov1 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:4ba76ae904568c7c7e0b01c60ae5d91d49e73860428844658c39b4c80bc93ce7
